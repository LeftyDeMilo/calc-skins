# Free42 Skins

[Free42](https://thomasokken.com/free42/) is an emulator of [HP-42S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-42S) calculator. It was developed by Thomas Okken. Nowadays it runs on iOS/Android smartphones and Linux/macOS/Windows operating systems.

A skin consists of two files: a `.gif` image and a `.layout` text file with the same name, e.g., `Awesome.gif` and `Awesome.layout` pair.

Skins could be made for portrait (vertical) and landscape (horizontal) orientations. Since there are no advantages to use Free42 in the landscape mode I decided to enable only the vertical mode. So here is no skins for horizontal mode.

Even though Free42 could scale skins of any resolution to fit a specific device screen, I preferred to make a skin for exact screen size.
